My solutions to the criptopal challenge

this project was used to learn about both criptography and rust it is therefore not to be taken seriously as a finished product or a product at all

rather as a collection of intellectual curiosities and an example of how badly a project can be tied up in a single file 

the actual solution are found in tests and can be verified with cargo test and the supporting function are in lib.rs
