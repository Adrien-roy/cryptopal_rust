# Cryptopal Rust Challenge Implementation

Welcome to the official documentation of my Cryptopal project.

This repository contains my implementation of the Cryptopal challenges available at [https://cryptopals.com/](https://cryptopals.com/).

## About Cryptopals

If you're unfamiliar, the Cryptopals challenges are designed to teach cryptography through practical problem-solving. According to the authors:

> *"This is a different way to learn about crypto than taking a class or reading a book. We give you problems to solve. They're derived from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic constructions. We provide enough information to learn the underlying concepts yourself. When you finish, you'll have gained a solid understanding of how cryptosystems are built and how they can be attacked."*

## Why I Built This

I decided to showcase my work on these challenges for the following reasons:

1. **Passion for the Project**: I find the Cryptopal challenges engaging and educational.  
2. **Lack of Rust Implementations**: At the time of writing, existing public repositories with Rust implementations are limited in scope or completeness.  
3. **Self-Learning and Growth**: I want to demonstrate my progress in Rust programming and cryptography by sharing my solutions.
